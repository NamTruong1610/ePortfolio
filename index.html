                <div class="reflection-card">
                    <h3>Reflection 1: Apply principles of sustainability to create viable systems (A)</h3>
                    <p>During the initial phase of my internship with UTS Optik Consultancy, my team was tasked with
                        developing a production scheduling system for a small furniture upholstery business. Our early
                        weeks focused heavily on documentation, client consultations, and researching suitable
                        technologies. At first, I felt frustrated by the lack of immediate coding progress, as I
                        perceived productivity purely in terms of development output. As an ambitious software
                        engineering student equipped with a technical foundation in data structures and front-end
                        design, my natural inclination was to immediately jump into the React development environment to
                        deliver features.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>However, this documentation-heavy phase proved to be a critical exercise in sustainable system
                        design, making sure that our solution would remain adaptable, maintainable, and aligned with the
                        client’s long-term operational needs. The client’s requirements were initially vague, stemming
                        from a business unfamiliar with software development. We realized that rushing to code would
                        have resulted in an inflexible, unsustainable system built upon a foundation of assumption
                        rather than confirmed need. The true challenge lay in translating the client's operational pain
                        points—such as inefficient manual job tracking—into defined, measurable, and enduring technical
                        specifications. This rigorous, collaborative requirements gathering, conducted through multiple
                        client meetings, became the essential precursor to creating a resilient system, shifting my
                        definition of productivity from lines of code to validated system architecture.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The challenge stemmed from unclear requirements and a non-technical client base, which initially
                        made the project direction ambiguous. Yet, this uncertainty became a valuable lesson in what
                        Elkington (1997) defines through the "“triple bottom line”", balancing social, environmental,
                        and economic sustainability. In our context, this principle was applied across several
                        dimensions of the software's life cycle. Economically, we had to ensure the system provided a
                        net benefit over manual processes, justifying the investment. Socially, we had to maximize
                        usability for the non-technical staff. Environmentally, the system needed to be efficient in its
                        resource use and adaptable to future technological changes to avoid obsolescence. By
                        prioritizing user understanding, process efficiency, and "system scalability"—demonstrated
                        through the successful application of "UX/UI wire-framing techniques" to streamline the job
                        creation workflow—we laid the groundwork for a viable and lasting solution rather than a
                        short-term software fix. This experience reinforced that sustainability in software engineering
                        extends beyond environmental factors; it encompasses usability, maintainability, and long-term
                        value creation (Penzenstadler et al., 2014).</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Furthermore, the choice of the "technology stack" was a direct application of sustainability
                        principles. We opted for "React" and "NodeJS" for the front and back-ends, coupled with
                        "PostgreSQL" for the database. This decision was driven by the economic and social
                        sustainability of the platform. Using widely adopted, open-source technologies ensures low-cost
                        maintenance and broad community support, minimizing "vendor lock-in" and reducing the client’s
                        long-term operational risk. My work in developing the front-end involved building modular
                        components for the job entry form and a responsive job table. This "modularity" is a key
                        maintainability feature, ensuring that future updates, bug fixes, or new feature
                        integrations—such as adding a field for a new material type—can be accomplished quickly and
                        locally without destabilizing the entire system. This is technical sustainability in practice:
                        the system's ability to evolve without extensive, costly rework.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Professionally, this experience reshaped my understanding of what truly constitutes sustainable
                        engineering practice. The extensive documentation and requirement-gathering phase was
                        fundamental to ensuring system resilience and client satisfaction. It forced me to use tools
                        like "Figma" to iterate on design, effectively treating the user interface as a foundational
                        requirement rather than a superficial feature. As Geissdoerfer et al. (2017) argue,
                        sustainability-driven design requires a "circular mindset", where systems are built for
                        continuous improvement and adaptability. This means moving beyond the linear 'build-and-deliver'
                        model to one where the system's longevity and adaptability are built-in features. In this light,
                        our initial focus on stakeholder engagement, applying wire-framing to the UX, and choosing a
                        scalable architecture directly supported the principles of sustainable system development. The
                        integration of front-end components with "RESTful APIs" was done not just for functionality,
                        but to ensure that the system's data layer remained decoupled and easily transferable, which is
                        vital for long-term viability.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Looking forward, I intend to embed sustainability considerations at every stage of the software
                        lifecycle, from requirement analysis to deployment, by evaluating long-term maintainability,
                        resource efficiency, and user adaptability. This includes adopting formal practices to mitigate
                        future risks, such as implementing "detailed technical debt logging" and creating
                        comprehensive "non-technical maintenance handover guides" for the client. This approach
                        elevates the engineering process from mere problem-solving to responsible, holistic system
                        creation. This commitment to designing enduring, viable, and responsible systems not only aligns
                        with Engineers Australia’s (2017) expectations for professional competence but also ensures that
                        the solutions I help design remain viable, responsible, and future-ready, truly bridging the gap
                        between technical innovation and measurable, long-term impact.</p>

                <div class="reflection-card">
                    <h3>Reflection 2: Professional Practice within intercultural and global contexts (F)</h3>
                    <p>The development of the custom inventory management system for a local furniture upholstery
                        business was a significant real-world test of my professional practice within an intercultural
                        and global context. As a Vietnamese international student and software engineer, I was part of a
                        project team composed entirely of other Australian software engineering students. Our technical
                        domain was shared, yet our cultural and professional communication backgrounds were distinct,
                        and our client had virtually no software or tech knowledge.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Initially, a palpable communication gap existed, not just between the team and the client, but
                        also within the team itself. My Vietnamese cultural upbringing often emphasizes indirect
                        communication and deference to group harmony, which, when combined with my initial shyness in a
                        new environment, meant I was initially reserved and hesitant to voice confusion or contribute
                        assertively. This led to an environment where we didn't talk much, and critical clarifications
                        were sometimes delayed, hindering the initial progress of the software design, particularly in
                        translating the client's business needs into technical specifications.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The turning point came when my confusion over a specific user story related to fabric inventory
                        tracking became too significant to ignore. I took the initiative to ask detailed, clarifying
                        questions, laying out the gap in my understanding to the team. This single act had a
                        surprisingly positive effect. By modeling vulnerability and a sincere desire for clarity, I
                        implicitly gave permission for others to do the same. My teammates quickly followed suit,
                        admitting their own uncertainties on other project aspects. This shift unlocked a much more
                        open, inquisitive, and collaborative dynamic. We began to gel well, realizing that our shared
                        engineering discipline provided a common language, but our different cultural approaches
                        required mutual effort to bridge.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>This incident was significant because it underscored the principle that proactive communication,
                        even when challenging or uncomfortable, is an indispensable catalyst for effective global
                        collaboration. It demonstrated the necessity of establishing a "psychologically safe"
                        environment, a concept highlighted in organizational behaviour research (Edmondson, 1999), where
                        team members feel safe to speak up without fear of embarrassment or punishment. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>While internal team communication improved, I recognize a major shortfall in my engagement with
                        the client. The client, an Australian-run furniture upholstery business, was entirely unfamiliar
                        with software development. Based on my teammates' discussions about their past experience
                        working in retail, I incorrectly deferred all client communication to them. My reasoning was
                        that their cultural background and prior retail experience would make them better equipped to
                        understand and translate the client's business language and cultural nuances.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>This decision, though well-intentioned, was a critical missed opportunity. By standing back, I
                        missed the chance to actively learn and practice cross-cultural communication skills in a
                        professional context. Effective communication with non-technical stakeholders requires
                        translating complex ideas into simple business terms and adapting to different professional
                        communication styles (e.g., direct versus contextual). In essence, I allowed my cultural
                        deference and initial fear of miscommunication to override the need for practical skill
                        development.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Looking back, the experience provided invaluable lessons in both cross-cultural and
                        cross-disciplinary professional practice.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>If I were to approach this again, I would proactively seek to lead or co-lead client discussions
                        on specific, well-defined technical features, such as data input or reporting interfaces. This
                        would force me to exit my comfort zone, directly developing the communication skills I avoided.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Furthermore, my positive experience with my Australian teammates reinforced the idea that
                        learning about other cultures and communication styles is not merely a formality but a
                        fundamental tool for success. It helped me understand that a more direct and informal approach
                        can facilitate quicker, clearer consensus, a style I now consciously aim to integrate while
                        retaining the politeness valued in my own culture. This insight aligns with research on Cultural
                        Intelligence (CQ), which posits that the capacity to function effectively across national,
                        ethnic, and organizational cultures is a critical predictor of success in global work
                        environments (Ang & Van Dyne, 2015).</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Going forward, I aim to strengthen my intercultural competence by applying structured frameworks
                        in global projects and by seeking regular feedback on my communication approach from diverse
                        team members. I will actively work to understand the cultural dimensions that impact
                        professional settings, for example, the concept of low-context versus high-context cultures
                        (Hall, 1976), recognizing that Australian professional contexts are generally lower-context,
                        requiring more explicit verbal communication than the higher-context culture I am used to. This
                        conscious application of theory will help me transition from simply reacting to cultural
                        differences to strategically adapting to them, ensuring that I leverage diversity to build
                        meaningful relationships and work effectively together.</p>
