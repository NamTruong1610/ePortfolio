            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a fourth-year software engineering student with a strong interest in solving real-world problems through practical software solutions. I’m particularly driven by the challenge of designing, developing, and deploying systems that meet specific user needs while maintaining scalability and performance. I possess strong theoretical and technical foundations in data structures and front-end web design and aim to enhance my technical proficiency, teamwork, and communication skills through collaboration with industry professionals.</p>
            <p>My recent internship experience in developing a production scheduling system for a furniture business deepened my interest in software’s potential to create tangible impact in operational contexts. It also reinforced the importance of collaboration, adaptability, and understanding end-user requirements. I remain curious, ambitious, and committed to continuous improvement, aiming to build practical, effective solutions that reflect both technical precision and real-world utility.</p>

                    <h3>Embracing the Process: Lessons in Project Scoping</h3>
                    <p>During an internship project, my team and I initially felt unproductive during the early phases, which were heavy on documentation and client meetings rather than coding. My initial belief was that productivity is measured by immediate feature development. However, I now understand that for projects with non-technical clients and vague requirements, this initial discovery phase is the most crucial step. This foundational work is essential to accurately translate a client's needs into a functional solution. In the future, I will approach this phase with more patience, recognizing it as vital for ensuring the final product aligns with client requirements.</p>

                    <h3>Finding My Voice: Growth in Client Communication</h3>
                    <p>A significant personal challenge I faced was my approach to client communication. As an international student, I was initially hesitant to speak in client meetings, often relying on teammates to convey my ideas. While this was effective for the project, I realized my silence was detrimental to my personal growth. I learned that good communication is not just about perfect expression, but about empathy and transparency. Moving forward, I am committed to stepping out of my comfort zone and actively participating in client discussions, understanding this skill is fundamental to my future career as a competent and well-rounded engineer.</p>
